## Setup

Download the package from [Releases](https://github.com/Shealynntate/Glow_Fade_Effect/releases/tag/v1.0) and import it into your Unity project.
This demo is meant to be used as a starting point for designing your own fading effects.
The shader parameters exposed in the editor should give you full control over the effect.
